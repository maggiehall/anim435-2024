# Create Colored Object Tool
## overview
this tool creates either a cube or sphere in MayaPy. It assigns the object a lambert material of either white(default), red, green or blue. The result is saved to a specific .mb file.
## Usage
```python
- '--shape': Specifies the shape ('cube' or 'sphere').
- '--color': Specifies color of material ('red', `green`, `blue`, or `white`). Default is white.
- '--output': Path where the '.mb' Maya file will be saved.
```
# Note For Professor:
Hello. I did my best with this assignment but I got quite lost using git bash. I rewatched the lecture and portions of it multiple times to try and figure out what I was doing wrong. I was eventually able to use the aliasing so that mayapy would work. However, I was never able to figure out how to create a .mb file using git bash like you did in the video. I would type out mayapy and then the folder location with the make-sphere, like how you had in the video, but it wasn't working.I tried several different tweaks to the command and couldnt figure it out.

That being said. I rewrote the code from last week to the best of my abilities but because I couldn't figure out gitbash, I couldn't see if what I was doing was correct.

If I am able to join class (we are expected to be traveling then so I don't think I will be able to) I will stay during lab time to ask for help. If I can't I will select an offic hour time. So sorry :(
